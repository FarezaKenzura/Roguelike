# Roguelike

This project is a 2D Roguelike game built based on the Unity Learn. The primary focus of this repository is to showcase the implementation of core gameplay mechanics and the C# scripting behind them, demonstrating how different systems interact to form a cohesive game loop.

I have also implemented several custom adjustments and optimizations to the original tutorial logic to improve gameplay flow and script efficiency.
